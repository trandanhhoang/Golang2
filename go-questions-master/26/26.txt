Q: What is the size of the following struct?

```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "unsafe"

func main() {
	s := struct {
		A float32
		B string
	}{0, "go"}

	fmt.Printf("%T, %d\n", s, unsafe.Sizeof(s))
}
```

a. 12
b. 8
c. 12 bytes on architectures with 4 bytes pointers and 24 on architectures with 8 bytes pointers
d. 24

A: c
